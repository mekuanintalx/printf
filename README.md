# 0x11. C - printf
[_printf.c](./_printf.c) 
The printf project is a collaboration between Mekuanint Legese and Ola Tarig Hashim Mahjob, Students of Software Engineering at ALX, were a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

---
## Write a function that produces output according to a format.

* Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
* Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
* write output to stdout, the standard output stream
* format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. 
* You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:

        * c
        * s
        * %
* You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
* You don’t have to handle the flag characters
* You don’t have to handle field width
* You don’t have to handle precision
* You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

------
## Handle the following conversion specifiers:
        * d
        * i
    
------    
## Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
        * b the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
---
## Handle the following conversion specifiers:
        * u
        * o
        * x
        * X
----
## Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible
---
## Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
        * S : prints the string.
        * Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)
----
## Handle the following conversion specifier: 
        * p
---
## Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:
        * +
        * space
        * #
---
## Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers:
        * l
        * h
        *Conversion specifiers to handle: d, i, u, o, x, X
----
## Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
---
## Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
---
## Handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
---
## Handle the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
---
## Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
        * r : prints the reversed string
---
## Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
        * R: prints the rot13'ed string
## All the above options work well together.
